Cryptsy-Socket version 0.01
============================

This module is designed to make it easy to connect and collect
broadcasts in real time from the Cryptsy trading exchange.

You are advised to use this as a base class for your own module.

Your module will simply fill in the trade() and order_book() routines.
These are the callback routines that are called as soon as a new
broadcast is received from Pusher (the provider of the Cryptsy socket).

There is a sample test script module which simply dumps the messages
to your teminal.
